# Python-Script-For-Plot-Generation-PROOF
This Scripts is used to generate two histograms for data gathered from PROOF program. It was my first Python program.

This script uses matplotlib, numpy and os libraries. And is meant for data generated with PROOF (ESA program), so it cannot generate plots from other type of data.
